## 1. Initialize Terraform

```bash
cd terraform
terraform init
```

---

## 2. Review variables

Variables are managed through terraform.tfvars to keep the execution simple and reproducible. No command-line variables are required.
Edit terraform.tfvars as needed.

Default (HTTP only – works out of the box)
```hcl
aws_region  = "eu-west-1"
name        = "wp-topcom"
alert_email = "name@mail.com"
max_tasks   = 8
```

Optional: enable HTTPS (requires domain ownership)
```hcl
enable_https     = true
domain_name      = "example.com"
site_fqdn        = "wp.example.com"
create_dns_alias = true
```

---

## 3. Plan

```bash
terraform plan
```

---

## 4. Apply

```bash
terraform apply
```

With HTTPS enabled
When HTTPS is enabled, the user must own the domain and have DNS management access.
ACM DNS validation may take several minutes to complete.


---

## 5. Confirm Email Subscription

AWS SNS sends a confirmation email to alert_email.  
You must confirm it to receive alerts.

---


## 6. Access WordPress

After apply, Terraform outputs:
```text
alb_dns_name = wp-test-alb-123456.eu-west-1.elb.amazonaws.com
```
HTTP (default)
Open in browser:
```text
http://<alb_dns_name>/
```

HTTPS (if enabled and domain configured)
Open in browser:
```text
https://wp.example.com/
```
---

## 7. Destroy

Destroy all resources:
```bash
terraform destroy
```
